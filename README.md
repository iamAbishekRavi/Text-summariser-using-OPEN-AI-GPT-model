Project Overview
This project extracts text from a PDF file and generates a summary based on a given topic using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. It utilizes Python to read the PDF, extract the text from specific pages, and then sends that content to OpenAI's API for summarization.

How it Works
Extracting Text from PDF
The text is extracted from a range of pages from a provided PDF file using the PyPDF2 library. The pages can be specified in the code for better control over which sections of the book or document to summarize.

python
Copy code
import PyPDF2

# Read the PDF file
file_path = "your-book.pdf"
book = ""
with open(file_path, "rb") as file:
    reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
    total_pages = len(reader.pages)
    start_page = 23
    end_page = total_pages - 30

    for page_num in range(start_page, end_page):
        page = reader.pages[page_num]
        book += page.extract_text()
Generating the Prompt
The extracted text is then used to generate a prompt based on a given topic. The prompt is designed to guide the model in providing a summary relevant to the topic, which can be set in the code.

python
Copy code
# Example topic: "money"
topic = "money"
prompt = f"Summarize the key ideas related to '{topic}' from the following text:\n\n{book}"
Sending Request to OpenAI API
The extracted text and prompt are sent to OpenAIâ€™s API using the openai Python client. The API returns a summary based on the provided prompt. The response is then printed or saved for further use.

python
Copy code
import openai
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Set API key
openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPEN_AI_API_KEY')

# Request for a summary
response = openai.Completion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Using GPT-3.5 model
    prompt=prompt,
    max_tokens=500,
    temperature=0.3
)

# Extract and print the summary
summary = response.choices[0].text.strip()
print(summary)
Limitations of the Free API Tier
This project utilizes OpenAI's free-tier API key. The free-tier access comes with the following limitations:

Limited Token Count: The number of tokens that can be processed in a single request is restricted, which may limit the amount of content that can be summarized at once.
Model Access: Only certain models (such as gpt-3.5-turbo) are available for free-tier users, meaning you may not have access to the most advanced models like gpt-4.
To handle these limitations, we ensure that the extracted text is kept concise, and only a subset of the text is processed for summarization to stay within the token limits.

Conclusion
This Python project demonstrates how to integrate OpenAI's GPT model for summarizing text extracted from a PDF. It is a basic example that can be expanded by adding error handling, more advanced features like topic detection, or expanding the document parsing capabilities.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of your project, with code snippets to illustrate the key steps. It also includes details about the limitations when using the free-tier OpenAI API key.
